### Added
- **Payroll module v0 — payslip ledger.** The fourth real module is live (no
  longer a placeholder). Records what each employee was paid in each pay
  period; no payroll math is computed here. Pillars:
  - Schema: `payroll_runs` + `payslips` (migration 057). Run totals computed
    on read; payslip rows snapshot employee name/email at write time.
  - Domain: `modules/payroll/domain/{runs,payslips}.ts` — full CRUD + finalize.
    Finalized runs are immutable from the API/UI.
  - Admin UI: `/payroll/runs` (list with totals), `/payroll/runs/[id]` (detail
    with editable payslip rows while draft, locked once finalized).
  - Self-service UI: `/me/payslips` (history), `/me/payslips/[id]` (printable
    detail). User-scoped via `employee_profiles.user_id`; never leaks across
    employees.
  - Sub-agent: `delegate_to_payroll` joins ATS / CRM / HRIS in the orchestrator
    with 3 read-only tools — `list_payroll_runs`, `get_payroll_run`,
    `get_employee_payslips`.
  - Flag: `NEXT_PUBLIC_PAYROLL_ENABLED` (default on); sidebar gates admin nav
    + employee "Payslips" item.
  - Scope deliberately excluded for v0: tax/statutory engine, bank
    disbursement, CSV import, PDF generation. All additive in v1.

### Changed
- Sidebar nav rearranged for clearer planning/execution separation. Under
  **Recruiting**, items now read `Openings → Jobs → Pipelines → Candidates →
  Sourcing → Sequences → Inbox` (Jobs before Pipelines reflects the legacy/
  canonical ordering; Inbox joined Recruiting since it's an action feed, not
  analytics). **Insights** is now `Analytics` only. HRIS / Me / Admin sections
  unchanged. Openings stayed in Recruiting (not HRIS) because HRIS is
  admin-only and Openings must remain visible to recruiters.

### Fixed
- Onboarding no longer loops users who set up their workspace but didn't click
  through to the final "All set" screen. `onboarded_at` was stamped only by the
  done step's client-side effect, so connecting an integration mid-onboarding
  (which bounced the user back to the integrations step) and then closing the
  tab left it `null` forever — every subsequent login re-ran onboarding even
  though, e.g., Slack was already connected. Now completion is stamped
  server-side and idempotently (`markOnboarded`) once the required steps are
  persisted (`requiredStepsComplete`): on *reaching* the integrations step and
  again on the done screen as a backstop.
- OAuth connect/install flows started from the onboarding integrations step now
  carry an explicit `origin=onboarding` signal through the signed OAuth state,
  so callbacks return the user to that step instead of inferring the
  destination from `onboarded_at` (which is now set earlier). Settings-initiated
  connects are unchanged.

### Changed
- Extended the emerald brand theme across the app (52 files: landing page, public
  apply/schedule/intake flows, dashboard pages, and shared components). Converted
  brand/interactive blue — buttons, hover/focus states, focus rings, gradients,
  link text — to emerald. **Categorical status colors were deliberately
  preserved** (e.g. candidate `active`, pipeline stages, scorecard `yes`/`Good`
  ratings) so distinct states stay visually distinct. Light-blue decorative
  panels (`bg-blue-50` callouts) were left as-is and can be greened later.

### Docs
- Rewrote `README.md` into a real first-look entry point with a "Start here"
  reading path to `CLAUDE.md` and the canonical data-model docs.
- Refreshed `CLAUDE.md`: corrected stale counts (migrations 27→48+, API routes
  60+→130+, copilot tools 20+→~38, tests 13→37), added a Canonical Data Model
  section linking the `docs/` files and documenting the `src/lib/domain/*` facade
  convention, and surfaced `npm run audit:canonical`.
- Added this `CHANGELOG.md` as the running progress log.

### Removed
- Deleted `AGENTS.md` — it was a corrupted duplicate of `CLAUDE.md`
  (`Claude`→`Codex` text swap from another tool). `CLAUDE.md` is the single
  source of truth.
